故乡，多么亲切的称谓！这里的所有过往都是铭记在心的回忆，无论什么时候想起皆是一样的眷恋。

The vast plains gradually disappeared from behind me, a day at noon faintly heard the sound of the Yellow River surges, actually it's my illusion, the Yellow River, flow gently with like see the nu river, after may contain under the calm is thunderous imposing manner, it's just that I saw them in inappropriate places so that moving momentum did not show it.
Then see yellow water seemed to be flooded with the track, our mother river and I met in this journey, she didn't give me the unexpected surprise, really, she and I later see later to laterite plateau river, just different from their color.
The train passed by on the Yellow River bridge in a few minutes, I know the Yellow River abandoned me, I also have lost the Yellow River, from now on I do not know which day I will come back to see her, I only dream of rivers incredibly flashing in my eyes just a few minutes, then I'd like to see the desire of the Yellow River in zhengzhou in the speeding train.
But not too clear impression.
Looking back on the day of the lunar New Year, and now the ground leaving only firecrackers debris flying in the wind, flutters in the Spring Festival in the spring breeze warm festival.
And during a fresh fragrant air days as the pentium horse in a hurry.
I know, now the only way is to get a pen to hard work.
